plymouth (0.8.0~-1) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Michael Vogt ]
  * merged from the fastboot PPA

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Rebased on latest GIT from bzr import.
    - Directly applied debian/patches/01_default_fb.patch
    - Directly applied debian/patches/03_set_default_plugin.patch
    - Directly applied debian/patches/13_use_tty7.patch
    - Directly applied debian/patches/11_create_pid_file.patch
    - Dropped debian/patches/12_wait_for_sigterm.patch:
      + We're not going to shutdown plymouth when X starts, simply
        deactivate it.  Upstart pre-stop and SIGTERM handling should
        therefore be sufficient.
    - All other patches were from GIT and are already in the tree, so
      dropped them too.
  * Changed packaging to use dh 7 instead of cdbs.
  * Changed to install into /lib rather than /usr
  * Removed old init scripts and Upstart jobs to tidy up package.
  * Added symbols file for the libraries.

  * Disabled the crash handler, since it does something very silly when
    X is running.
  * Added initramfs conf that enables the framebuffer and plymouth unless
    the root disk is on SSD.  The rationale is that SSD-based systems get
    to the point where we can start plymouth in the real system just as
    fast, while HDD-based systems have to do ureadahead first and we want
    something pretty on screen while that happens.
